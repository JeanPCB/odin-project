ANSWERS:

01 -> ** * % / + -

02 -> An integer do not have decimals while float has

03 -> .to_i

04 -> .to_f

05 -> A string is a sequence of characters

06 -> With double quotes you can use other features like string interpolation

07 -> String interpolation is the act of put variables into our string

08 -> You can use the concat operators "<<", "+" or the .concat method

09 -> .upcase

10 -> .split

11 -> Escape characters are characters provided with a "\" before them representing the character itself or an especial character like "\s" that represents a white space

12 -> You can access it by the index of the character or methods that perform it

13 -> .to_s method

14 -> A symbol is an "immutable" string, it only has one allocated memory space for each symbol

15 -> :symbol

16 -> A string can allocate multiple spaces in memory for same string content while symbol only allocate one memory space for his content

17 -> True is a boolean data type that represents something is true, often translated to 1

18 -> False is a boolean data type that represents something is false, often translated to 0

19 -> Nil is a special ruby way to represent that something is "undefined", since that everything in Ruby returns something, nil returns "nothing"
